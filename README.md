# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
To create a R script run_analysis.R to collect and clean data to form a tidy dataset.
It should do the following:
1. Merge the train and test dataset to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
